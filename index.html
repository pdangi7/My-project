       “I thought in my heart, ‘Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good.’
       …I tried cheering myself with wine, and embracing folly—my mind still guiding me with wisdom. 
      I wanted to see what was worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few days of their lives.
      I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards. 
      I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them. 
      I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees. I bought male and female 
      slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and 
      flocks than anyone … before me. I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure 
      of kings and provinces. I acquired men and women singers, and a harem as
      well—the delights of the heart of man. I became greater by far than anyone … before me. 
       In all this my wisdom stayed with me….I denied myself nothing my eyes desired;
       I refused my heart no pleasure. My heart took delight in all my work, 
       and this was the reward for all my labor.” (Ecclesiastes 2:1-10)

      Man’s fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies,
      so dies the other. All have the same breath; man has no advantage over the animal.
       Everything is meaningless.  All go to the same place; all come from dust, 
       and to dust all return. 21 Who knows if the spirit of man rises upward and 
       if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?” (Ecclesiastes 3:19-21)

      All share a common destiny—the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad, 
      the clean and the unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who do not. As
       it is with the good man, so with the sinner; as it is with those who take oaths, 
       so with those who are afraid to take them. This is the evil in everything that 
       happens under the sun: The same destiny overtakes all. … they join the dead.  
       Anyone who is among the living has hope—even a live dog is better off than a dead lion!
        For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward, 
        and even the memory of them is forgotten. Ecclesiastes
      “Meaningless! Meaningless!” says the Teacher. ‘Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless.’ 
      … I … devoted myself to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. 
      What a heavy burden God has laid on men! I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; 
      all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.” (Ecclesiastes 1:1-14)

      “…when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve everything was
       meaningless, 
      a chasing after the wind; nothing was gained under the sun… So my heart began to despair over
       What does a man get for all the toil and anxious striving with which he labors under the sun?… 
      This too is meaningless.” (Ecclesiastes 2:11-23)
